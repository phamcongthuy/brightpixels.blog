excerpt: Amazing news! I'm happy to see Hoefler & Co. offer the entire collection
  to web font subscribers. It was frustrating to be limited to five typefaces… forever.

> For years, Cloud.typography has included any five fonts of your choosing, and the rest available to purchase. Today we’re making things a lot simpler, a lot more flexible, and a *lot* more valuable: every Cloud.typography subscription now includes access to our complete library of fonts to use on the web.

Amazing news! Hoefler & Co. has such an amazing collection of fonts, it was a shame to be limited to *just five*. Can't wait to use more of these typefaces in my personal projects.
